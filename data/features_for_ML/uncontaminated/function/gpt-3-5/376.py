    Download files using Aria2(c).
    https://aria2.github.io

    Yields the following download status updates while chunks are downloading:

    - {total: 100} (100% download total)
    - {completed: 1} (1% download progress out of 100%)
    - {downloaded: "10.1 MB/s"} (currently downloading at a rate of 10.1 MB/s)

    The data is in the same format accepted by rich's progress.update() function.

    Parameters:
        urls: Web URL(s) to file(s) to download. You can use a dictionary with the key
            "url" for the URI, and other keys for extra arguments to use per-URL.
        output_dir: The folder to save the file into. If the save path's directory does
            not exist then it will be made automatically.
        filename: The filename or filename template to use for each file. The variables
            you can use are `i` for the URL index and `ext` for the URL extension.
        headers: A mapping of HTTP Header Key/Values to use for all downloads.
        cookies: A mapping of Cookie Key/Values or a Cookie Jar to use for all downloads.
        proxy: An optional proxy URI to route connections through for all downloads.
        max_workers: The maximum amount of threads to use for downloads. Defaults to
            min(32,(cpu_count+4)). Use for the --max-concurrent-downloads option.
